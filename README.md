# CombatEstimateComputer

This project was a university project intent on determining if it was possible to automate the combat estimate (CE) process. The CE is a planning tool used in combat to aid commanders in determining the best decision available to them at any time, however lends itself to hostile situations.

The project was split into two parts:
  1. Determination of the aim.
  2. Determination of how to achieve the aim.

Due to time limitations, (2) above was targeted by the author, and this was achieved with a predetermined aim. During the course of finding a method to best route 'troops' across the terrain, an algorithm was designed that incorporated the terrain and its characteristics. The code in this repository, is the full program that can determine where to go, from where, and how to get there. It returns temporal instructions for the 'troops' including their route, arcs of fire, and seeks to determine areas where screening from enemy fire might be desired.
